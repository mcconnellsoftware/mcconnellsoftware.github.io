_Aug 2021: Beyond 'hello world' and technology intro material, hearing about experiences from others in the real world 
can be a great way of really learning what tech is capable of - and where it falters._

Over the years some of the articles I've enjoyed most have been tech "deep dives". Teams or individuals telling a 
story: we did a thing, here's how we did it, here are a few of the fun adventures had along the way.

What worked well - and what didn't.

I've started a list here of those I've enjoyed recently. I'll add to this from time to time, as and when I find 
particularly memorable new ones on Hacker News basically.
