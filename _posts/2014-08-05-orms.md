I’m not sure I’d agree that ORM is the
[Vietnam of Computer Science](http://blog.codinghorror.com/object-relational-mapping-is-the-vietnam-of-computer-science/), 
but the topic is like tech recruitment: it keeps popping up for people to argue about how to do it best. 

This latest salvo summarises my own thoughts fairly well:

[What ORMs have taught me: just learn SQL](https://wozniak.ca/blog/2014/08/03/What-ORMs-have-taught-me-just-learn-SQL/index.html)

Another one that resonates for me personally:

[ORM is an anti pattern](http://seldo.com/weblog/2011/06/15/orm_is_an_antipattern)

NoSQL architectures aside, I really don’t get why people don’t just embrace SQL with the rich ecosystem of views, 
procs, functions, tuning techniques, monitoring techniques, etc, that you just cannot get from limiting your database 
access to `customer.save();`. Each to their own, I suppose.
