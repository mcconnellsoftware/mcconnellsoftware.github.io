Trying to explain, as a programmer to a Normal Human, why one’s day sucked can often lead to “you know, never mind”. 

Tales of spending all day trying to debug index/query problems, then finding it’s still a 5 year old “major” JIRA, 
don’t excite much in the way of sympathy. You can usually just skip to: stuff didn’t work, and I spent all day failing 
to change that.

Bad day = wasn’t even my fault. Terrible day = it _was_ (oops).

This essay covers the horror splendidly:

So from now on it will be my default read-this-while-I-grab-my-beer proxy excuse for coming home grumpy.
