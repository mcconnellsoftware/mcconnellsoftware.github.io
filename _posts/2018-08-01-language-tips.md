*Watch out for these common misuses to avoid compromising otherwise great content.* 

I've spent more time on the title for this one than the content I think. Because I know how infuriating the smug 
"9 language mistakes YOU are making - you must be a MORON"! style of articles are, and I really don't want to invite 
the wrath of the doing-fine-without-your-snarky-grammar-pedantry majority of writers who are indeed doing fine without 
any of my unwanted interference. 

But, having read several chapters of Lynne Truss' wonderful, readable and 
funny [Eats Shoots and Leaves](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Eats-Shoots-Leaves-Lynne-Truss/dp/0007329067) I now feel 
compelled to go on a bit about the mistakes everyone else is making.

Really though, I'm writing this to try and gently, politely, helpfully, flag a few common misuses that people who are 
genuinely great at writing and communicating and properly Know Their Stuff occasionally introduce, and my hope is that 
these small tips might help others the way many other writers have helped me over the years. 


**Insure/Ensure/Assure**

You _insure_ your car or house - with _insurance_. 

You _ensure_ you don't get stung for your round at the bar by keeping meticulous records of when your friends have, 
and have not, "got theirs in".

You can also _assure_ your friends you will never do this again when they call you out on it and threaten to stop 
inviting you along.


**Weary/Wary**

_Weary_ is tired, _wary_ is cautious. You might be _weary_ of being corrected by people on the internet or Twitter, 
but still _wary_ of physically getting into an actual fight about it.


**Enquire/Inquire**

You might _enquire_ of your kids why exactly they're playing on their tablets at 3am and whether they 
think it will really help them concentrate on their 4 Times Tables in the morning.

_Inquire_ is a bit more formal, and leads to perhaps a Government _Inquiry_ - but even sneaky 3am iPad manoeuvres don't 
really merit that level of response.


**Imply/Infer**

These are commonly mixed up - they're _directional_ though. I might strongly _imply_ to my spouse that I've already taken 
the dog for a walk and if she chooses to _infer_ from that _implication_ that the little pest no longer needs his daily 
trundle round the streets that's fine, everyone wins! 


**Tenet/Tenant**

A _tenet_ is a principle or belief: a central _tenet_ of good coding is that you don't just copy/paste a method from 
one module into another, for example, and obviously none of has ever done that eh, HA HA, IMAGINE THAT. 

However: if I owned a bunch of Silicon Valley apartments and rented them out to coders, and any of the _tenants_ in those 
properties violated that simple _tenet_ of engineering food practice? Well! They'd be out on the streets, pronto! 
We're not having that sort of thing. We're not _animals_.


**Torrid/Torrent**

You wouldn't download music of off BitTorrid would you? BitTorrent though - different ballgame there, much easier.

_Torrid_ is used in a bunch of different ways but usually indicates intensity/difficulty/turbulence, e.g. last year we 
had a _torrid_ time of it at the Black Friday "7 TVs for Â£50" event, people were literally stabbing one another in the 
knees to get in.

A _torrent_ is more of a flow, such as the torrent of colourful abuse one might hurl at the CI server as it enters its 
3rd hour of building.  


**Loose/Lose**

This crops up a lot lately; no idea why. Loose means "not tight", or to set free. You don't generally _loose_ your 
car keys, at least not deliberately, you _lose_ them - and then they're lost, not loosed.


**Complement/Compliment**

Java and Spring _complement_ one another nicely - they are a good match. What wonderful _synergy_ - business bulldust 
word of the year 1997 - that _complementary pairing_ brings!

But if I noticed someone had written 64 DAO Java classes for a Spring application with just 7 DB tables, I don't think 
I'd pay them the _compliment_ of saying "Marvellous design you have there! Splendid!" I might even suggest they've 
overdone it with the _complimentary_ beers beforehand at the team's big recruitment event...
 

**Affect/Effect**

Nothing is more liberating than realising none of your mistakes actually _affect_ the company's bottom line in any 
meaningful way.

_Affect_ is what you _do_, e.g. I might often try to _affect_ my chances of being allowed out to the pub by 
cooking an unusually tasty meal for the family.

The _effect_ is the outcome: my endeavours for a beer pass might have no _effect_ whatsoever.

You can _effect change_, meaning "to bring about" change, but of course those of us working in Enterprise Software have 
long since given up on that!

And with that, I can only hope all this may have a positive effect on your own writing, patient reader who's got this 
far, and not affected your reading enjoyment on the Intertubes today _too_ badly...
