_Oct 2018: The fact that people - well, companies mostly - have been doing me the great courtesy of paying me to produce 
software for them for more than 21 entire years leaves me feeling incredibly lucky - and faintly horrified at 
just how quickly that time has passed. Increasingly often, new grads joining me in the workplace will be younger than 
the bugs I've left behind, so it seems a good time to pause and reflect!_

Have I learned anything in 21 years of professional software development? Well, yeah, a whole bunch of stuff! I've been 
paying _some_ attention!

Some of it's obsolete now, not least all the cool Excel stuff I could do before Microsoft excreted its damned Office 
Ribbon thing into the world thing leaving me unarmed and bewildered. But some of it could, perhaps, by particularly 
kind observer, be called some form of wisdom. Facts, anyway. Experience.

I've avoided writing down the 300-odd "crucial tips" I'd give 22-year-old me because there's plenty of that sort of 
stuff already out there, and it's very well done too - no point regurgitating it here.

A career - a life, really - is as the saying goes _a marathon, not a sprint_. I think you need to have lived a bit, to
have built some experience - of wins, of losses, personal and professional - to really appreciate that. One thing you 
certainly can't appreciate when you first start out in your career is how much you'll change in the years to come - but 
also how little. Philosophical stuff, right???

Something I've been thinking about a lot lately is success - what is it? How important is it? What types of success are 
there? And most importantly to me right now, what sort is most worth pursuing? 

We all want a successful career. I'm lucky enough to think I'm enjoying one - so far, anyway, and with high hopes that 
long it may continue, large lottery wins notwithstanding. I've seen colleagues from similar software development 
backgrounds as me take many different routes over the years, though, and achieve many different types of success.

# Success != happiness

The single observation that's most prompted my reflection on all this is seeing people accept promotions into roles 
they plainly don't enjoy. Every graduate loves making it from _Junior Developer_ to _Developer_. Every _Developer_ loves 
getting to _Senior Developer_. 

But the jump from _Senior Developer_ to _Manager_, in role and in daily activity if not in title, catches people 
out - myself included, but I was fortunate to realise after a few months "away from the coal face" that frankly I didn't
enjoy it as much as I enjoyed working hands-on with technology. Happily I was able to pivot back to the hands-on side, 
no harm done.

That others choose to continue down paths they're plainly not happy with puzzles me. Obviously some people 
genuinely love managerial jobs, and thrive in executive roles, just as some people are born salespeople - it's the 
people who _don't_ that get me thinking, the ones who wistfully recall their hands-on days as they navigate a 
Tetris-like calendar.

Things that can be considered "success":

- job titles: "Chief VP of Global Blockchain Engineering" what a big-hitter this guy must be right!

- "fame", or at least having a highly visible profile, and "influence" 

- money - wealth is one of the most universally recognised indicators of success, after all

- enjoying the challenge and the impact of the hands-on work you do, day in, day out, on its own merits

- having flexibility and control over one's workload, working patterns, and the ability to balance work, family, 
friends, leisure, hobbies, etc

It strikes me that 2 of the above are status measures, 2 are happiness measures, and 1 is actually a bit of both: 
money genuinely makes some of life's more severe problems disappear, allowing a level security, stability and even 
luxury - and if you're doing _particularly_ well you can plonk an Aston Martin in the driveway. Quite the status
indicator, that...

My less-than-earth-shattering insight is maybe just that perhaps the trappings of status are hard to give up even when
our happiness is at stake. Obviously it's for every individual to make their own choices in life, and there are complex
factors in play - 10 years into a management or leadership role, you perhaps _literally can't_ just get back into the 
"fun techie stuff", for example.

# Perspective

I've always inherently been a believer in delayed gratification - who, committing to a 3 or 4 year degree course isn't,
in some small part - and right now I believe in the importance of _balance_. 

Contemplating the nature of success, I suspect the 22-year-old me would have a different view of what he wanted 
43-year-old me to be doing than - should I be lucky enough to get there - what 64-year-old me might want to look back 
at. 

Maybe not though. Maybe they'd both think "stuff the balance, get the Aston Martin whatever it takes, loser!"

Stayed tuned - I'll try my best to report back in 2039!
