_Oct 2018: The fact that people - well, companies mostly - have been doing me the great courtesy of paying me to produce 
software for them for more than 21 entire years leaves me feeling incredibly lucky - and faintly horrified at 
just how quickly that time has passed. Increasingly often, new grads joining me in the workplace will be younger than 
the bugs I've left behind, so it seems a good time to pause and reflect!_

Have I learned anything in 21 years of professional software development? Well, yeah, a whole bunch of stuff! I've been 
paying _some_ attention!

Some of it's obsolete now, not least all the cool Excel stuff I could do before Microsoft excreted its damned Office 
Ribbon thing into the world thing leaving me unarmed and bewildered. But some of it could, perhaps, by a particularly 
kind observer, be called some form of wisdom. Facts, anyway. Experience.

I've avoided writing down the 300-odd "crucial tips" I'd give 22-year-old me because there's plenty of that sort of 
stuff already out there, and it's very well done too - no point regurgitating it here.

A career - a life, really - is as the saying goes _a marathon, not a sprint_. I think you need to have lived a bit, to
have built some experience - of wins, of losses, personal and professional - to really appreciate that. One thing you 
certainly can't appreciate when you first start out in your career is how much you'll change in the years to come - but 
also how little. Philosophical stuff, right???

Something I've been thinking about a lot lately is success - what is it? How important is it? What types of success are 
there? And most importantly to me right now, what sort is most worth pursuing in "Career, Act II"? 

We all want a successful career. I'm lucky enough to think I'm enjoying one - so far, anyway, and with high hopes that 
long it may continue, large lottery wins notwithstanding. I've seen colleagues from similar software development 
backgrounds as me take many different routes over the years, though, and achieve many different types of success.


# Success != happiness

The single observation that's most prompted my reflection on all this is seeing people accept promotions into roles 
they plainly don't enjoy. 

Every hopeful job seeker relishes getting that first break, that first _Junior Developer_ opportunity.

Every young engineer loves making it from _Junior Developer_ to _Developer_. 

Every _Developer_ loves getting to _Senior Developer_.  

But the jump from _Senior Developer_ to _Manager_, in role and in daily activity if 
not in title, catches some people out: myself included, and I realised after a few months "away from the coal face" that 
frankly I didn't enjoy it as much as I enjoyed working hands-on with technology. Happily I was able to pivot back to 
the hands-on side, no harm done.

That others choose to continue down paths they're plainly not happy with puzzles me. Obviously some people 
genuinely love managerial jobs, and thrive in executive roles, just as some people are born salespeople - it's the 
people who _don't_ relish that step up that get me thinking, the ones who wistfully recall their hands-on days as they 
navigate, sighing, the meetings in a Tetris-like calendar, and armour-up for another bout of white-collar conf-call combat.

Some things that can be considered "success" - a far from complete list:

- titles: "Chief VP of Global Blockchain Engineering" - it's impressive, snarky blockchain dig aside!

- "fame", or at least having a highly visible profile, and "influence" 

- money - wealth is one of the most universally recognised indicators of success, after all

- enjoying the challenge and the impact of the hands-on work you do, day in, day out, on its own merits; this can be 
creative, scientific, athletic, administrative, working with animals - doesn't matter, it's purely 
a _doing something you love_ indicator  

- having flexibility and control over one's workload, working patterns, and the ability to balance work, family, 
friends, leisure, hobbies, etc

- helping others, perhaps medically or in a social or caring capacity, or in a teaching role

It strikes me that although two of the above could be seen as status measures, most are happiness - or at least 
satisfaction - measures, and one is actually a bit of both: money genuinely makes some of life's more severe problems 
disappear, allowing a level of security, stability and even luxury - and if you're doing _particularly_ well you can 
plonk an Aston Martin in the driveway. Quite the status indicator, that...

My less-than-earth-shattering insight is just that perhaps the trappings of status are hard to give up even when
our happiness is at stake. Obviously it's for every individual to make their own choices in life, and there are complex
factors in play - 10 years into a management or leadership role, you perhaps _literally can't_ just get back into the 
"fun techie stuff", for example - we all know technology doesn't stand still. 

I do believe though there's something in our collective human psyche that works against us here: imagine your neighbour 
gets a stunning new car - that Aston Martin, say. She leaves the house at 6am each day, doesn't get back till 9pm, but 
wow, she must be _killing it_ at work to get that car. 

Would you swap? You sure? What factors might sway you?

None of the above are mutually exclusive, it's worth bearing in mind: if being European VP of Machine Learning 
Containers gives you fame and fortune, with a 4 hour workday and a shot at ending poverty and you love every minute - 
great! 

(NB I would always be available for this role if anyone has it...?)


# The Non-linear Career

Of course what we value and strive towards as young adults isn't necessarily something that stays with us over a whole 
career (or lifetime). 

I recall the excitement and impatience I had as a graduate engineer, and the exhilaration of hitting promotions and 
pay rises. There's nothing wrong with that: it's a good way to start out, and probably a safe "default" from which to 
develop and grow.

As things turned out my own course took a few turns, all of which have eventually turned out well, thankfully: left a 
large consulting firm to join what would be called a "startup" these days. Moved from that to some roles in banking 
technology, and into some freelance work. Then back to a small startup type firm - and then back into freelance banking 
tech again!

It's important to be aware of other routes and perhaps to conduct "right path checks" every so often - every 5 to 10 
years anyway, it needn't be a weekly ordeal:

- do I really want that next promotion, i.e. do I want to be doing each day the work that people _already in that role_ 
do? This is not a trick question: if you answer yes, go for it - there's absolutely nothing _wrong_ with being 
successful! But don't jump blindly into something you'll likely hate - especially if _those around you_ give every sign 
of hating it!

- am I enjoying the day-to-day as-is? If not, why not? Are there small tweaks that could help?

- is my workload about right? "Too light" is arguably just as damaging "too heavy" here!

- where do I want to be in 5 years? 10 years? It's a cliched interview question but a good career question to 
ask yourself from time to time - and one to which it's worth thinking carefully about your answer

Careers can take surprising turns, and with an appreciation that success can take many forms, it's well worth being 
open to exploring options that come along: you might _think_ you want to solve the worlds Big Data replication problems 
but you might discover that teaching new graduates a _Starting Out With SQL_ course and helping someone who's been 
struggling with a concept suddenly "get it" gives you more of a buzz than you've had in years!


# Perspective

I've always inherently been a believer in delayed gratification - who, committing to a 3 or 4 year degree course _isn't_,
in at least some small part - and right now I also believe in the importance of _balance_. 

Contemplating the nature of success, I suspect the 22-year-old me would have a different view of what he wanted 
43-year-old me to be doing than - should I be lucky enough to get there - what 64-year-old me might want to look back 
at. I find "what would Retired Me want to look back on from his mansion in the Algarve?" quite a good way to guide my 
thinking.

Maybe not though. 

Maybe they'd both think "stuff 'balance', get the Aston, loser!"
