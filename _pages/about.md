## A bit about me...

I’m a software developer working mainly with Java, Spring, SQL and NoSQL databases, and smatterings of other good stuff: JSON, XML, scripting languages and whatnot. I’m based in Central Scotland.
 

## ...and a bit about this site

This site is a place for me to write down some of the ideas that my peaceful commute fosters, and worst case it will save some of my colleagues the trouble of listening to my theories in office kitchens – a hyperlink here is so much more polite.
